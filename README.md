# Decentralized Healthcare Data Exchange Platform

## Overview

This blockchain-based Healthcare Data Exchange Platform provides a secure, privacy-preserving, and efficient solution for managing and sharing sensitive medical information. By leveraging smart contract technology, the system ensures patient privacy, data integrity, and controlled access to healthcare records.

## System Architecture

The platform consists of four critical smart contracts, each addressing a key aspect of healthcare data management:

### 1. Patient Consent Contract
- **Purpose**: Manage and enforce patient data sharing permissions
- **Key Functionalities**:
    - Enable granular consent management
    - Allow patients to control data access
    - Support dynamic consent modification
    - Implement time-based access permissions
    - Provide revocable access tokens
    - Ensure informed and explicit consent

### 2. Provider Verification Contract
- **Purpose**: Validate and authenticate healthcare entities
- **Key Functionalities**:
    - Verify medical professional credentials
    - Maintain a trusted registry of healthcare providers
    - Support multi-level authentication
    - Validate institutional accreditations
    - Prevent unauthorized access
    - Implement real-time credential checks

### 3. Record Access Contract
- **Purpose**: Control and manage access to medical information
- **Key Functionalities**:
    - Implement role-based access controls
    - Granular permission management
    - Support partial record access
    - Encrypt sensitive medical data
    - Enable context-specific data sharing
    - Maintain data confidentiality

### 4. Audit Trail Contract
- **Purpose**: Track and log all interactions with medical records
- **Key Functionalities**:
    - Create immutable access logs
    - Record detailed interaction metadata
    - Provide comprehensive access history
    - Support forensic investigations
    - Enable patient-initiated access reviews
    - Ensure transparency and accountability

## Key Technical Features
